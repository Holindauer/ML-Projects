This Directory is not the Focus of this Repository, that focus would be found within
the Deep_Learning Directory. As such the contents here is not as regularly maintained 
or added to compared to Deep_Learning. 



Within this directory are many of my Initial Explorations with Machine Learning
algorithms and models. These would include Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, 
Linear Regression, SVM, GMM, KNN, PCA, KMeans, etc. ie not deep learning. As well
as learning various python libraries like Sci-Kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy.

This is where I built up my initial foundation and intuition for my current projects.
