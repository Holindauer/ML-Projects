# ML-Projects

This repository contains my intial explorations in machine learning. It
contains two main directories. ML_Fundamaentals is where I familiarized 
myself with how machines learn using gradient descent with linear models.
After gaining these intuitions I began learning about Deep Learning in 
the Deep_Learning directory. Intially I learned tensorflow but later made
the switch to PyTorch. As such most projects are in tensorflow.

I am no longer adding to this repository. I have since moved on to ML projects that require more software engineering to implement. The concepts I am currently exploring are Transformers and NLP (as of August 6, 2022).
