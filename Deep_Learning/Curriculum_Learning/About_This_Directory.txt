Curriculum Learning is a Deep Learning Training technique where easy task are introduced into the model,
mastery is achieved, then the difficulty of the task is increased. 

This directory contains experimentation and implementation with curriculum learning. 

Note on the language used within the first 4 notebooks. When I original began this curriculim learning project,
I began with the promising notion of increasing the difficulty of the task as well as increasing the complexity 
of the model as training progressed. My initial research did not turn up that this technique bears the name 
curriculum learning. As a result, The first four notebook use the term complexity scheduling to mean the same
thing.
